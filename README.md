# Low Poly Beach Day Scene

A 3D recreation of a low-poly landscape using Three.js, featuring:

- Procedurally generated terrain with simplex noise
- Realistic water with reflections and animations
- Dynamic sky with sun
- Low-poly trees placed on terrain
- First-person camera controls

## Features

- **Terrain Generation**: Created using multi-layered simplex noise for natural-looking hills
- **Water Reflections**: Realistic water surface with dynamic reflections and distortions
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Sun position affects lighting and reflections
- **Low-Poly Aesthetics**: Maintains a stylized, low-poly look
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
